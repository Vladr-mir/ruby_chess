## Move rules

Each player have their own set of pieces they can move using the [algebraic notation](http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/chess.html).

To move your piece use the [algebraic notation of chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation) like this: "`Nf3 Nc6`". if the move is valid the position of the piece will be updated and your turn will finish, else the position will not be updated and you will be asked to enter a valid move.
